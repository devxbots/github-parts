# ðŸ”© github-parts

`github-parts` is an opinionated integration with the GitHub platform, used by
[DEV x BOTS] for its automations. It contains _types_ for the resources provided
by GitHub through its API, and _actions_ that can interact with the platform in
various ways.

## Status

We are actively developing `github-parts`. Its API and functionality are not
stable and can change at any time. During this period, we don't accept code
contributions to the project.
